## Description
Modify wall clock to make it highly useful and beautiful at the same time. Using RGB LED diodes build in a clock frame, highlight selected pie pieces of a clock face. Using that highlighting and all RGB colors you can visualize events from your calendar in next 12 hours, or show sunrise and sunset time by showing in corresponding place yellow (sunrise), blue (sunset) colors. There is a ton of potential uses and due to that controlling app (Android and iOS) will be able to use add-ons created by users to show own data on a clock, or just a fancy colorful animations.

## Link to Prototype
Almost done, it is after first presentations on local GDG event about DevArt but it is not stable, as soon as it will be I will publish here videos, photos, and code to use. Stay tuned!
