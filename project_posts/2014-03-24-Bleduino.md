#Bleduino
As time goes on project as well goes on. Bleduino finally arrived (not without pain and explanation on customs) and is ready to be mounted instead of Arduino Leonardo. In short words Bleduino is Ardiono+Bluetooth 4.0 on micro board. Sounds great, isn't it? But in reality it isn't as there is almost no documentation of how to communicate with build in bluetooth module (and I'm not an expert in that matter, as it is my first bigger project with Arduino).

#3D printing
I wish.. but it seems that it isn't for me :( After a few days of delay I got a model (this time made by professional 3D graphic), and today it finally went to printing, however (when I thought that case is closed) it come to light that there is some problem in center of model and printer goes crazy. I will try my best to make it real till deadline (3 more days to go), but it doesn't look good.

//Later on I will at least upload model (stl file), and some screenshots for you guys!

Plan for today and tomorrow is to solder legs of Bleduino (it isn't simple), and start work on better mobile app (and publish its code).
