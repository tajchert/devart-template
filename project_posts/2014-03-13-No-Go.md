#A No-Go

It was a hard day in a project life as RGB LED strip (60 leds per meter) refused to work, during last day it sometimes had a random blinks in random places, I did what I could but it seems to be dead.

Good news is that new one is already on its way (there no time to waste), and it has astonishing **144 leds per meter**. AMAZING! But it was not the end of my shopping, as I decided to implement **Bluetooth 4.0**, I needed a shield for my Arduino with it. However I found **Bleduino** which seems to have everything that I need and is small so it may benefit in future (or in some other project).

Stay tuned as I will soon post some scatches and mockups, after that (if LED strips still won't be here) I will focuse my work on the Android app.
