#Local fame

To encourage local developers and artist, there was and event made by GDG Warsaw about DevArt. It was awesome and I had my 5 minutes (on the stage) to present my idea, working prototype, and tell people that they also can participate even if there is no much time, as a proof for that I gave my project. I started work on Friday 7th of March - in just 3 days I had working prototype and a ton of already solved problems that I didn't expect at first place.
But it is **FUN!**

[My presentation](http://goo.gl/2UkQlB "My presentation"), I got a lot of positive feedback about my idea, hope you will like it too.
