#Local fame

To encourage local developers and artist, there was and event made by Warsaw GDG about DevArt. It was awesome and I had my 5 minutes (also on the stage) to present my idea, working prototype, and tell people that they also can participate event if there is no much time, as a proof for that I gave my project. I started work on Friday 7th of March - in just 3 days I had working prototype and tons of already solved problems that I didn't expect at first place.
But it is **FUN!**
