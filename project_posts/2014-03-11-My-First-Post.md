#Initial post

I will use it to tell you shortly how and when it started as it is a quite old idea, but for long time it was abandoned by me - DevArt gave me the motivation!
Idea of that clock came to my mind a year ago, with all that hype about smartwatches I was strike with the thought that on all screenshots they use an analog clock as a main clock face - which for me was a huge draw back and lost opportunity to use such thing as smartwatch...

First mockup of the idea - made a year ago.

##The Idea
Use a clock face to represent event from your calendar - but not only, any data that changes during time and we can predict - like temperature, sea tides, chance of rain, traffic to work etc. 


I made it come true on January 2014, app called 12Hours was published, and I have posted it on Reddit and was a huge success there (over 4k upvotes), app was mentioned in number of places and websites, few of them also gave it "the app of the month" title (for example by AndroidPolice). All of it resulted in over 100, 000 download in first 36 days since publishing app.

From the beginning I was thinking about making it as a physical clock that you can hang on the wall and admire - more busy. As I heard about DevArt in beginning of March I thought it would be a great motivation for me to start working - right away I have ordered few things from Adafruit - mainly NeoPixel strip of 60 RGB LEDs.

**Since 7th of March I'm working hard to make it till deadline, and present the best clock ever. Stay tuned for more over time, I will publish with every breakthrough in project.**
