#3D Model
As buying 5V 8A power supply seems to be almost impossible I have decided to go with computer power supply as it provides up to 28-30A (depending on a model) on the 5V line. So tomorrow I will start day with buying used one, and let's hope that 144 strip will work smoothly.

60 RGB LED strip is broken as its whole bath from producer - Adafruit already send a replacement one, but last time it took about a week to get a package from them (USA -> Poland).

In a meantime I decided to make a first 3D model of that clock. For 3D printing - I'm still looking for a company in a neighborhood which will print it for reasonable price.

The cut in bottom part of a clock is made for wires in a prototype version - I will deal with wiring as soon as I got Bleduino.
Also there is a hole in center for clock mechanism for clock hands, in final version I would like to control them from Arduino level but it is a bit of work.

RGB LED strip will go under part with digits so it will be nicely hidden, also thanks to separators on a clock face colors won't mix so much.

Model files are available on the GitHub project site.
