I have made a small diagram to show what is project about - in easy to read diagram.

Last weekend I have participated in hackathon (as work on 12Hours slow down due to broken LED strip), and got a 2nd place (amongs 15 teams, Central Open Data Hackathon).
But weekend is over and I should get back to work (12Hours), going after advice on adafruit forum I have cut off 1 LED in a strip and soldered cables to the second one... it started working! But from what I have read it is not only my problem (that 1st LED dies) - as a temporary solution 10k Ohm resistor between data and ground is recommended. I don't have such so I will wait with palying some test code till I got one (tomorrow).
Also 144 LED strip arrived - but since it needs ~38W (5V 8A) power supply, I will have to buy such tomorrow as well. Using spare time I already prepared and soldered cables to it as it arrived without them.

Again working LED strip - without one LED (you can see it on the right).
